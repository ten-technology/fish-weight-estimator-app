            <p>Welcome to the Fish Weight Estimator App! This Privacy Policy outlines how your data is collected, used, and protected when using our app. At [Your Company Name or Developer Name] (referred to as "we," "us," or "our"), your privacy is very important to us.

            <p>We may collect non-personal data automatically to improve the App's performance and functionality:</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The input provided by users (length, girth, and fish type) is used solely for calculating fish weight estimates. This information is processed locally on your device to deliver the result in-app.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Retention Policy</h2>
