# Fish Weight Estimation Formulas

This document provides research-backed formulas to estimate the weight of various fish species using their length and girth. These formulas are widely used in fisheries science and angling communities.

## General Formula
The general formula for estimating fish weight is:

**Weight (W) = (Girth² × Length) / Factor**

Where:
- **Girth**: The circumference of the fish at its widest point (in inches or cm).
- **Length**: The total length of the fish (in inches or cm).
- **Factor**: A species-specific constant derived from research or empirical data.

## Notes
- Ensure that **length** and **girth** are in the same units (e.g., inches or cm).
- These formulas assume average fish condition. Fish that are unusually fat or thin may deviate from these estimates.
- For precise weight measurements, use species-specific length-weight regression equations derived from large datasets.
